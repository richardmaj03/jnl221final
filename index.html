        <p>The world of professional sports may look glamorous from the outside, but what many don't see is the difficulties that professional tennis players go through to a liveable profit. Unlike team sports, for example, basketball, football, and soccer, tennis players don't have team contracts that guarantee pay. Professional tennis players generate their revenue through tournament prize money and endorsement deals. These sponsorships usually do not come unless you are a player ranked inside the top 50.</p>
        <p>This year's tournament prize money was at an <a href="https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2023-08-08/2023_us_open_prize_money_and_player_compensation_to_total_65_million.html">all-time high</a> at $65 million. It seems like a lot but when adjusted for inflation, it’s not too far off from the standard over the last few years. This means that rather than dramatically increasing the amount given to players, tournament organizers have redistributed the prize money.</p>

        <p>In 2022, the USTA began reporting how much prize money was allocated for those who fall in the qualifying rounds of the US Open. Qualifying happens the week before the tournament, and anyone who wins a third round match gets a spot in the main draw.</p>

        <p>In recent years, tournament organizers have begun helping players with personal expenses. This year this includes travel vouchers of $1,000 as well as an increase in meal allowance and racquet stringing. All players will also receive either an additional hotel room, or see their hotel allotment doubled from $300 to $600 per day if the player chooses to stay elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Someone who knows about the stress of the tour is Richard Henry. Henry played on scholarship at Jackson State before winning a national title with Tyler Junior College. He spent some time on the professional tour before stepping back to coach, including a short stint with former world number 14, Ivo Karlovic. The Barbados native said that when playing at the lower levels, it’s difficult to make money, so the changes the US Open has made will help players.</p>

        <p>“If I win one of those lower level tournaments, I make $3,600,” Henry said. “Now, we have to minus your taxes, that’s 30% out of the gate. Then, I've got to pay my coach, if I’m traveling with one. I might have to string some frames while I’m there, my transportation, my hotel. Before you know it, I might walk away with $500.”</p>

        <p>Henry said that the lack of profit has led to players taking measures to save money like sharing coaches with other players. He said you will find coaches going to watch one player before running over to go watch another player. He also said that players at lower levels don’t get to sightsee like many top players do. Rather, once they’re done at one tournament, they’re traveling to go compete in another.</p>

      <p>From 2019 to 2021, prize money for players who made the second week of the US Open decreased, while it increased from 2021 to this year. This has sparked controversy from fans who believe the decrease in prize money over the last two years was a good change. Players still made a high amount of money while allowing for the players who lose in earlier rounds to earn more. In those same time zones, redistribution saw the opposite. Even though it keeps increasing, the 2019 to 2021 redistribution of prize money favored players who lost in the first week more than it has over the last two years.</p>

        <p>With the measures put together to help pay players’ personal expenses, many hope that players will be able to walk away from the US Open with a fair profit. On the other hand, even if they make a fair profit, most would have to spend it on future expenses. For male professionals, that may now change as the ATP announced their “Baseline” program on Dec. 14. The program offers guaranteed base earnings and income protection (for players who get injured) for players in the top 250. It also includes what’s being called “newcomer investments” which will be $200,000 for every player who breaks into the top 125.</p>

        <p>In 2021, Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil created the <a href="https://www.ptpaplayers.com/about/"> Professional Tennis Players Association</a>, or PTPA, which “addresses player challenges and influences fair change within the business of professional tennis.” With all of these initiatives arising, many players hope that they’ll be able to make playing the sport they love a viable career.</p>
